Example 1: 
Question: Which of the following pulp horn of primary molar is commonly exposed during restorative procedures? 
Choices: A. Mesiobuccal puplhorn of 1st molars. B. Distobuccal pulp horn of 1st molars. C. Mesiobuccal pulp horn of 2nd molars. D. Distobuccal pulp horn of 2nd molars.
Answer: During restorative procedures, specific pulp horns are more likely to be exposed due to their prominence and position. For primary molars, the mesiobuccal pulp horn of 1st molars is anatomically more susceptible during cavity preparation. So, the answer is A.

Example 2:
Question: On abdominal ultrasound gallbladder shows diffuse wall thickening with hyperechoic nodules at neck and comet tail aifacts. The most likely diagnosis will be:
Choices: A. Cholesterol crystals , B. Adenocarcinoma of gallbladder, C. Xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis, D. Adenomyomatosis 
Answer: The ultrasound findings of diffuse wall thickening, hyperechoic nodules, and comet tail artifacts suggest a benign condition with hyperplastic changes. Adenomyomatosis involves gallbladder wall thickening, mucosal overgrowth, and intramural diverticula containing cholesterol crystals, which produce characteristic ultrasound artifacts like the comet-tail sign. So the answer is D.


Example 3: 
Question: Which of the following statement is not true about glomerular basement membrane? 
Choices: A. Glomerular basement membrane acts as filtration barrier B. Glomerular basement membrane is stained with PAS, C. Type III collagen is present, , D. Glomerular basement membrane is involved in charge dependent filtration. 
Answer: The glomerular basement membrane (GBM) is a crucial component of the filtration barrier in the kidney. It is stained with PAS due to its glycoprotein content and facilitates charge-dependent filtration. Its primary structural component is type IV collagen, not type III collagen. This makes the statement about type III collagen incorrect. So, the answer is C.
